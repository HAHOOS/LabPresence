<h1 align="center">LabPresence</h1>

**The mod does not work on Quest, because Discord does not support RPC on Android**

This mod adds the support for Discord Rich Presence.

<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

* Full customizability of what's displayed.
* Full support for LabFusion, including joining and more.
* Placeholders for further customization (the list can be found in UserData > LabPresence > README.txt that's generated when the mod gets initialized).

<h2 align="center">Credits</h2>

This mod mostly relies on [discord-rpc-sharp](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp), without the library it would have been very difficult for me to get this mod done. So most of the credits go to the person behind the port, [Lachee](https://github.com/Lachee)
